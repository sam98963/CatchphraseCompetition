# Catchphrase Competition - Week 9 recap task - In collaberation with Catherine G!
An application that allows users to submit a catchphrase. All catchphrases are then displayed, a few featured catchphrases are also displayed including a random one, and the top three. Users can upvote their favourites.

### Motivation
This task was a consolidation tasks based on learning API endpoints the previous week. We were set a tasked to create the functions, route handlers and handle errors correctly in the back end. We then wanted to link it up to a front-end to create a fully functioning app, based on the data we were initially given, we thought a suitable app would be a simple 'Catchphrase Competition' app.

### Lessons Learned
- Triggering fetches to particular endpoints and tying to components in the front end.


### Tech Stack
- React
- Javascript
- CSS
- Express
- Thunderclient to handle test requests.

### Improvements
We plan to add in some additional routes, possibly to search for particular catchphrases. We would also like to make the styling a little more slick and implement some middlewear to log user interactions.
